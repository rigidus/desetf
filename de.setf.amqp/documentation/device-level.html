 &apos;de.setf.amqp&apos; library.</div>
<div  class='documentation' style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em;white-space: pre;'>Device-level operations are managed by channel instances, which delegete in turn to
connection-wrapped tcp sockets. The AMQP standards permit this combination to behave in either of (at
least) two ways. On one hand, one can use all allowed protocoal variability and treat the socket
<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> as a multiplexed multi-channel <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference class'>stream</a>. In this mode each thread would instantiate its own
<a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a> on the shared <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a>. On the other hand, is also possible to constrain the connection&apos;s use
to dedicate it to a single <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a> - and thereby to a single thread.

 The multiplexed mechanism sets a much lower demand for system resources, but increases the processing
for a single <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a> and constrains the i/o operations to block mode. A dedicated mechanims requires
more sockets, but can dedicate the buffering to a single thread, which permits more efficient i/o
operations.

 When the socket is multiplexed, then it is possible that content frames for one <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a> will be
interleaved with frames for another <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a>, which means it is not possible to guarantee that a given
socket read operation will contain an expected content <a  href='frames.html#frame' class='reference class'>frame</a>. The multiplexing requires per-channel
queuing and processing upon delivery, whereby the actual buffer is not to be predicted. When the socket
is dedicated, read operatation can target a given buffer, since the intra-channel ordering constraints
require that content be delivered in-order and uninterrupted. The protocol meta-data can be read and
processed in-line ro parameterize the read and recognize exceptions, while data i/o targets given
buffers. The 1.0pr documentintroduces additional <a  href='classes.html#session' class='reference class'>session</a> and context for <a  href='frames.html#frame' class='reference class'>frame</a> processing, but those are
not considered here. (see amqp0-8.pdf,p.56 amqp0-9.pdf,p.35)

 In the implementation below, the two amqp classes - <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> and <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a>, are each specialized from
simple-stream and implement the standard interface. The required device operators are implemented for
both amqp:<a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> and amqp:<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>connection</a>, despite that <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> operations are limited to channels while
connections are to be used only to consolidate frame-based operations with the network <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a>. The
principle operators are

    device-open (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> #-sbcl slots initargs)
    device-close (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> abort)
    device-read (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> buffer start end blocking)
    device-clear-input (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> buffer-only)
    device-write (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a> buffer start end blocking)
    device-clear-output (<a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a>)
    device-flush (device)
    device-read-content (device &amp;rest content-arguments)
    device-write-content (device body &amp;rest content-arguments)

 The device-open operator returns an instance which can be used directly. In the case of a <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a>, it
connects to the respective <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> and prepares any exchange/queue specified in uri initialization
argument.  In that state it can be supplied to <a  href='commands.html#publish' class='reference class'>publish</a>, <a  href='commands.html#consume' class='reference class'>consume</a>, or <a  href='commands.html#get' class='reference class'>get</a> operations to initiate <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference class'>stream</a>
i/o, or to transfer isolated objects. In the case of a <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a>, a socket <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference class'>stream</a> is opened to the
designated server and the protocol handshake and open-connection phases are completed. (see
open-connection and negotiate-client-connection) In that state, one can construct and use channels. In the
case of a <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a>, it should be used only to make channels. Note that the <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> class is adjusted to
match that of the protocol version which it negotiates with the remote broker. That is, a

    (make-instance &apos;amqp:<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a>  :uri &quote;amqp://guest:guest@localhost/&quote;)

will return a <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> sub-class. This places constraints on the effective methods for `device-open` and the
various constituents of the standard instantiation protocol for `simple-stream`.
The respective effective methods for the base implementation look something like

    initialize-instance : (<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>CONNECTION</a>) (STANDARD-OBJECT)
    shared-initialize (in mcl) : (<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>CONNECTION</a> T) (AMQP-DEVICE T) :AFTER (SIMPLE-STREAM T) (STANDARD-OBJECT T)
    reinitialize-instance : (STANDARD-OBJECT)
    device-open (in sbcl) : (<a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>CONNECTION</a> T) (AMQP-SOCKET-DEVICE T) (AMQP-DEVICE T) (SIMPLE-STREAM T) (SLOT-OBJECT T)

The exact form depends on the run-time (cf. `standard-object` v/s `sloto-object`), but all share the topology,
that no next method call follows the class change. Should protocol-specific specialization be necessary, any
specialized operation subsequent to the change would need to be independent of these effective methods.

 The device-read and device-write operators are defined at the respective levels to delegate a channel&apos;s
operations to the respective <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>connection</a> and to perform <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference function'>connection</a> i/o through the socket <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference function'>stream</a>. When
<a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> operations  with an explicit buffer, are intended to implement data stream-based data transfer
for a <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> which has already initiated a message <a  href='classes.html#exchange' class='reference function'>exchange</a> and observe the body size constraints
specified fro the message. Where the size is known at the outset, the body-size and body-position govern
eof behaviour. Where the size was unkown, the <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> implemented chunked transfer in terms of maxmial
sized messages, and relies on device-flush and device-clear-input to indicate and manage the effective
eof.

 The state operators for position and length return meaningful information for fixed content sizes only
and have no effect to modify <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a> state.

<div  class='documentation' style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em;white-space: pre;'>AMQP connection negotiation occurs in two steps. First, the peers agree on a protocol version. Second
they exchange  authentication and control information to set up the connection. The first step is
implemented by open-connection. It negotiates with the broker to agree on a supported protocol version
and changes the connection instance&apos;s class to that of the implementation class for that version. For
some protocol versions, it is also confronted with the initial <a  href='frames.html#frame' class='reference class'>frame</a>, which it buffers for the
configuration step.

 The second step, authentication and configuration, is implemented in negotiate-client-connection. It
exchanges <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> commands with the broker for authentication and tuning. The configured <a  href='classes.html#connection' class='reference class'>connection</a> is
returned.</div>
<div  class='documentation' style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em;white-space: pre;'>(device-read-content device-write-content)</div>
<div  class='documentation' style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em;white-space: pre;'>The content processing interface comprises the two operators
  * device-read-message (<a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> &amp;rest)
  * device-write-message (<a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference function'>channel</a> body &amp;rest)

 Each accepts the keywords which apply to the respctive protocol operation, that is, any method arguments and the class&apos;
 <a  href='classes.html#header' class='reference class'>header</a> properties. for reading this means the arguments for <a  href='commands.html#get' class='reference class'>get</a> and <a  href='commands.html#deliver' class='reference class'>deliver</a>, while for writing those for <a  href='commands.html#publish' class='reference class'>publish</a>.
 The interface supports two use patterns : <a  href='classes.html#body' class='reference class'>body</a> instances and continuation based. The decision is made by the writer
 according to whether the <a  href='classes.html#body' class='reference class'>body</a> size is known at the outset. For fixed length vectors this is true. For aeverything else, it
 is not. Where it is known, a single content-bearing command is sent. Where is it not known, A sequence of commands is
 sent until the writer terminates the <a  href='classes.html#stream' class='reference class'>stream</a> by indicating completion in a call to device-flush.

 Streams are broken into and reconstituted from the three <a  href='frames.html#frame' class='reference class'>frame</a> constituents for a command : method, header, and body.
 * a method frame : is emitted by a <a  href='commands.html#request' class='reference function'>request</a> operator and parsed and processed by the respond-to- operator to cache the
   arguments in the <a  href='classes.html#channel' class='reference class'>channel</a>. The protocol interface operator then invokes device-read/write-content.
 * a content header : ion inpt, s parsed in device-read-content/content-header to extract the properties and cache them
   in the channel&apos;s <a  href='classes.html#basic' class='reference function'>basic</a> class instance. On output, it is generated by device-write-content based on the channel&apos;s current
   <a  href='classes.html#basic' class='reference class'>basic</a> instance
 * the content <a  href='classes.html#body' class='reference class'>body</a> : is parsed based on the channel&apos;s internal type combined with the content type. It is generated
   based on the bassed body instance in combination with the content type /encoding.
