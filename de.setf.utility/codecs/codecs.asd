  :long-description
  "`de.setf.utility.codecs` implements binary codecs for Lisp data, buffers, and streams.
 The primitive types are integers and float values, and character sequences. The operators combine the
 core capabilities of the AMQP[[1]] data-wire-coding and Apache Thrft[[2]] binary protocol to serve as the
 base implementation for further codecs, such as BERT[[3]] and Apache Avro[[4]].
