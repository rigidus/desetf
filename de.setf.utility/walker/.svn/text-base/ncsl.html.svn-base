<P>This license is intended for parties who wish to use components from the <A HREF="http://www.setf.de/index.html">setf.de</A>
library for noncommercial applications. It permits one to copy and use the library
to develop noncommercial applications only. If one intends to use these components
in a commercial application, a commectial source license or a commercial binary license
is required instead.</P>
<P>Subclasses and additional methods are freely distributable. Distribution of Library
classes and functions themselves and changes to those functions and classes is subject
to restrictions.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying follow.</P>

<H2><A NAME="TERMS"></A>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING AND MODIFICATION</H2>
<P><STRONG>TERMS OF USE</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>0.</STRONG> This License applies to the <A HREF="http://www.setf.de/index.html">setf.de</A>
library software (the &quot;Library&quot;). The Library is made available as a source
archive (.tar file), and as individual source (.lisp) files. the Library comprises
Common Lisp functions and classes in various packages with the prefix <CODE>de.setf</CODE>.
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to this software, and a &quot;work based on
the Library&quot; means any Program or any derivative work which contains the Library
or a portion of it, either verbatim or as a linked component. Each licensee is addressed
as &quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> You have a non-exclusive right to copy the Library source
code as you receive it, in any medium, for your own noncommercial use, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately either retain on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty, and keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty.</P>
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy such modifications or work
under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> the source code may not be distributed, neither as verbatim
	copies nor as derivative works.
	<LI><B>b)</B> if the copy is a compilation of the Library, it is distributed under
	the terms of Section 3, below.
	<LI><B>c)</B> if the copy is a derivative work, it is distributed as an integral
	part of an end-user application, in binary form only, under the terms of Section
	3, below.
	<LI><B>d)</B> isolated, specialized functions and classes are not restricted by this
	license if they specialize the Library classes or functions through their public
	interfaces and function when linked with the Library's original binary form.<BR>
	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
	to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control
	the distribution of the Library and of derivative works based on the Library.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>3.</STRONG> You have a non-exclusive right to copy the Library in binary
form, as you receive it or as modified by you, in any medium, provided that it is
an integral part of a noncommercial, end-user application, and provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice,
assume full responsibility for any warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer
to this License, and give any other recipients of the Library a copy of this License
along with the Library.</P>
<P><STRONG>4. </STRONG>You may not aggregate the Library with of another work for
distribution - whether the other work is based on the Library or not, except under
the terms of Section 3, above.</P>
<P><STRONG>5.</STRONG>You may not charge a fee for a copy of the Library and you
may not offer services and/or programs and/or offer warranty protection whether directly
or indirectly related to the Library in exchange for a fee.</P>
<P><STRONG>6.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.</P>
<P><STRONG>7.</STRONG> If any portion of this license is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the license is intended to apply.</P>
<P><STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>A.</STRONG>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE
PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN THE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION OF ANY NUCLEAR
FACILITY AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR
SUCH USES.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>
<P><STRONG>B.</STRONG> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN WRITING WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>
